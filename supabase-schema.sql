-- Table-level privileges are a separate layer from the RLS policies below:
-- policies decide *which rows* are visible, but the API role still needs
-- the base grant or every request fails with "permission denied for table".
-- The project has "Automatically expose new tables" turned off (which is
-- what would otherwise issue this grant implicitly), so it's explicit here.

-- Policies are scoped to the "avail:" prefix rather than the whole table,

-- Live updates -------------------------------------------------------------
-- Publishing the table over Realtime is what makes its row changes reach
-- subscribed browsers at all, so a save in one shows up in the others
-- without a reload. This is a separate switch from the policies above: the
-- SELECT policy still decides who is allowed to receive a given row.
--
-- Wrapped because "add table" errors if the table is already published, and
-- this file is meant to survive being run a second time.

-- Send the whole pre-change row rather than just the primary key on update

-- too small for the extra write-ahead log volume to matter.

-- Archive photos -----------------------------------------------------------
-- Photos are files, so they live in Storage rather than in kv_store; what
-- kv_store holds is one small row per photo carrying its path. An image
-- inside a row would be pulled by every window query and pushed down the
-- realtime channel on every change, repeatedly and to everyone.
--
-- The size and type limits are not tidiness. Public read plus anon insert
-- with neither one is an open file host on this project's bandwidth: anybody
-- could upload anything, of any size, and serve it from this domain.

create policy "arhiv: nalaganje"

-- Deliberately no delete policy for anon. Read is public and there is no
-- login, so a delete grant would let any visitor destroy every photo -- and
-- unlike an availability entry, nobody has a second copy to retype it from.
-- Removing a photo from the app deletes its kv_store row, which takes it out
-- of the archive and leaves the file orphaned; purging files is a dashboard
-- job, done by someone who meant to.

-- Push subscriptions -------------------------------------------------------
-- One row per device, under its own "push:" prefix rather than "avail:". Two
-- reasons it is not squeezed into the avail namespace: personFromKey would
-- read the device id as a person and it would surface as a fake name in the
-- calendar, and every window query would carry these rows for no reason.
--
-- All four are granted, select included. Withholding select was tried first,
-- on the reasoning that only the sender reads these and the sender is an Edge
-- Function using service_role, which bypasses RLS anyway. It does not work:
-- RLS row visibility also governs the WHERE clause of update and delete, so
-- an upsert failed outright and -- worse -- a delete matched nothing and
-- reported success, which would have left dead subscriptions in the table
-- forever while the app claimed notifications were off.
--
-- What that would have protected is small in any case. A subscription cannot
-- be used to send anything without the VAPID private key, which is not here,
-- and the names in these rows are already public in the calendar itself. The
-- only thing select exposes is how many devices exist and their endpoint URLs.

-- The Edge Function that sends push notifications connects as service_role,

-- layers that made the anon grant above necessary. Without this it fails with
-- "permission denied for table kv_store" despite having every policy waived.

-- Notify on a new dogodek ---------------------------------------------------
-- Calls the notify-event Edge Function (supabase/functions/notify-event) so
-- everyone but the creator gets a push when an event is added.
--
-- This is what the dashboard's Database Webhooks UI builds, done by hand:
-- that UI needs a supabase_functions schema which only appears once webhooks
-- have been enabled, and this project has never had them. Reaching for pg_net
-- directly is also the better shape, because the key filter can live here --
-- availability saves, comments and photos never invoke the function at all,
-- where a webhook would have fired on every insert.
--
-- pg_net posts asynchronously, so saving an event never waits on the
-- notification and a slow or failed send cannot make the save fail.
